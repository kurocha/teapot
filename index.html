	<h1 style="text-align: center"><object type="image/svg+xml" data="materials/teapot.svg"></object></h1><p>Teapot is a decentralised build tool for managing complex cross-platform projects. It has many goals but it is primarily designed to improve the experience for developers trying to make cross-platform applications and libraries with a minimum of overhead.</p>
<ul>
<li>Provide useful feedback when dependencies are not met or errors are encountered.</li>
<li>Decentralised dependency management allows use within private organisations without exposing code.</li>
<li>Generators can simplify the construction of new projects as well as assist with the development of existing ones.</li>
<li>The build subsystem provides a simple set of canonical operations for building libraries and executables to minimise configuration overhead.</li>
</ul>

<section id="installation"><h2>Installation</h2>
<p>Ensure that you already have a working install of Ruby 2.0.0+ and run the following to install <code>teapot</code>:</p>
<pre><code>$ gem install teapot
</code></pre>
</section><section id="usage"><h2>Usage</h2>
<p>Please browse the <a href="source/index.html">source code index</a> or refer to the guides below.</p>


</section><section id="create-project"><h3>Create Project</h3>
<p>Firstly, create your project by running:</p>
<pre><code>$ teapot create &quot;My Project&quot; https://github.com/kurocha generate-project
$ cd my-project
</code></pre>
<p>You will be asked to merge the project file. At present, merge tools are not very good and thus you may need to take a moment to review the changes. You want to keep most of the original file, but you would like to add the <code>define_target</code> blocks which are being added.</p>
<p>In the resulting project directory that has been created, you can see the list of dependencies:</p>
<pre><code>$ teapot list
... lots of output ...
</code></pre>
<p>To only see things exported by your current project, you can run:</p>
<pre><code>$ teapot list root
Package root (from /private/tmp/my-project):

</section><section id="run-tests"><h3>Run Tests</h3>
<p>Testing is a good idea, and teapot supports test driven development.</p>
<pre><code>$ teapot Test/MyProject
</code></pre>
</section><section id="wildcard-targets"><h4>Wildcard Targets</h4>
<p>To run all tests:</p>
<pre><code>$ teapot &quot;Test/*&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>Provided you are using an environment that supports sanitizers, you can test more thoroughly using:</p>
<pre><code>$ teapot &quot;Test/*&quot; variant-sanitize
</code></pre>
</section><section id="run-project"><h3>Run Project</h3>
<p>We can now build and run the project executable:</p>
<pre><code>$ teapot Run/MyProject
I'm a little teapot,
Short and stout,
Here is my handle (one hand on hip),
Here is my spout (other arm out with elbow and wrist bent).
When I get all steamed up,
Hear me shout,
Tip me over and pour me out! (lean over toward spout)

                              ~
                   ___^___   __
               .- /       \./ /
              /  /          _/
              \__|         |
                  \_______/
</code></pre>
<p>The resulting executables and libraries will be framework dependent, but are typically located in:</p>
<pre><code>$ cd teapot/platforms/development/$PLATFORM-debug/bin
$ ./$PROJECT_NAME
</code></pre>
</section><section id="cloning-project"><h3>Cloning Project</h3>
<p>You can clone another project which will fetch all dependencies:</p>
<pre><code>$ teapot clone https://github.com/kurocha/tagged-format
$ cd tagged-format
$ teapot build Executable/TaggedFormat
</code></pre>
</section><section id="open-issues"><h2>Open Issues</h2>
<ul>
<li>Should packages be built into a shared prefix or should they be built into unique prefixes and joined together either via install or <code>-L</code> and <code>-I</code>?
<ul>
<li>Relative include paths might fail to work correctly if headers are not installed into same directory.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Should packages have some way to expose system requirements, e.g. installed compiler, libraries, etc. Perhaps some kind of <code>Package#valid?</code> which allows custom logic?</li>
</ul>
</section><section id="contributing"><h2>Contributing</h2>
<ol>
<li>Fork it</li>
<li>Create your feature branch (<code>git checkout -b my-new-feature</code>)</li>
<li>Commit your changes (<code>git commit -am 'Add some feature'</code>)</li>
