# ![Teapot](materials/teapot.svg)

Teapot is a decentralised build tool for managing complex cross-platform projects. It has many goals but it is primarily designed to improve the experience for developers trying to make cross-platform applications and libraries with a minimum of overhead.

  - Provide useful feedback when dependencies are not met or errors are encountered.
  - Decentralised dependency management allows use within private organisations without exposing code.
  - Generators can simplify the construction of new projects as well as assist with the development of existing ones.
  - The build subsystem provides a simple set of canonical operations for building libraries and executables to minimise configuration overhead.

[![Development Status](https://github.com/kurocha/teapot/workflows/Development/badge.svg)](https://github.com/kurocha/teapot/actions?workflow=Development)

## Installation

Ensure that you already have a working install of Ruby 2.0.0+ and run the following to install `teapot`:

    $ gem install teapot

## Usage

Teapot doesn't have a default centralised package management system but there is a [canonical one](https://github.com/kurocha) for developing cross-platform C++ applications. This example shows how to use this framework.

### Create Project

Firstly, create your project by running:

    $ teapot create "My Project" https://github.com/kurocha generate-project
    $ cd my-project

You will be asked to merge the project file. At present, merge tools are not very good and thus you may need to take a moment to review the changes. You want to keep most of the original file, but you would like to add the `define_target` blocks which are being added.

In the resulting project directory that has been created, you can see the list of dependencies:

    $ teapot list
    ... lots of output ...

To only see things exported by your current project, you can run:

    $ teapot list root
    Package root (from /private/tmp/my-project):
    	#<Teapot::Project "my-project">
    		My Project description.
    		- Summary: A brief one line summary of the project.
    		- License: MIT License
    		- Version: 0.1.0
    		- Author: Samuel Williams <samuel.williams@oriontransfer.co.nz>
    	#<Teapot::Target "my-project-library">
    		- depends on "Build/Files"
    		- depends on "Build/Clang"
    		- depends on :platform
    		- depends on "Language/C++14" {:private=>true}
    		- provides "Library/MyProject"
    	#<Teapot::Target "my-project-test">
    		- depends on "Library/UnitTest"
    		- depends on "Library/MyProject"
    		- provides "Test/MyProject"
    	#<Teapot::Target "my-project-executable">
    		- depends on "Build/Files"
    		- depends on "Build/Clang"
    		- depends on :platform
    		- depends on "Language/C++14" {:private=>true}
    		- depends on "Library/MyProject"
    		- provides "Executable/MyProject"
    	#<Teapot::Target "my-project-run">
    		- depends on "Executable/MyProject"
    		- provides "Run/MyProject"
    	#<Teapot::Configuration "development" visibility=private>
    		- references root from /private/tmp/my-project
    		- clones platforms from https://github.com/kurocha/platforms

    		- clones generate-cpp-class from https://github.com/kurocha/generate-cpp-class
    		- clones generate-project from https://github.com/kurocha/generate-project
    		- clones variants from https://github.com/kurocha/variants
    		- clones platform-darwin-osx from https://github.com/kurocha/platform-darwin-osx
    		- clones platform-darwin-ios from https://github.com/kurocha/platform-darwin-ios
    		- clones build-clang from https://github.com/kurocha/build-clang
    		- clones build-darwin from https://github.com/kurocha/build-darwin
    		- clones build-files from https://github.com/kurocha/build-files
    		- clones streams from https://github.com/kurocha/streams
    		- clones generate-template from https://github.com/kurocha/generate-template
    	#<Teapot::Configuration "my-project" visibility=public>
    		- references root from /private/tmp/my-project

### Run Tests

Testing is a good idea, and teapot supports test driven development.

    $ teapot Test/MyProject

#### Wildcard Targets

To run all tests:

    $ teapot "Test/*"

Provided you are using an environment that supports sanitizers, you can test more thoroughly using:

    $ teapot "Test/*" variant-sanitize

### Run Project

We can now build and run the project executable:

    $ teapot Run/MyProject
    I'm a little teapot,
    Short and stout,
    Here is my handle (one hand on hip),
    Here is my spout (other arm out with elbow and wrist bent).
    When I get all steamed up,
    Hear me shout,
    Tip me over and pour me out! (lean over toward spout)
    
                                  ~
                       ___^___   __
                   .- /       \./ /
                  /  /          _/
                  \__|         |
                      \_______/

The resulting executables and libraries will be framework dependent, but are typically located in:

    $ cd teapot/platforms/development/$PLATFORM-debug/bin
    $ ./$PROJECT_NAME

### Cloning Project

You can clone another project which will fetch all dependencies:

    $ teapot clone https://github.com/kurocha/tagged-format
    $ cd tagged-format
    $ teapot build Executable/TaggedFormat

## Open Issues

  - Should packages be built into a shared prefix or should they be built into unique prefixes and joined together either via install or `-L` and `-I`?
      - Relative include paths might fail to work correctly if headers are not installed into same directory.
  - Should packages have some way to expose system requirements, e.g. installed compiler, libraries, etc. Perhaps some kind of `Package#valid?` which allows custom logic?
